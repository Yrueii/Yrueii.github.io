    title: Introduction
    title2: What is Mindustry logic?
    content1: |
        Mindustry Logic (mlog) is a scripting language added in v6 for the purpose of introducing more advanced automation and strategy into the game.
        It is heavily inspired by Assembly languages, therefore the language is a low level language making it harder to understand (low level being low to machine language (Assembly, C, etc) and far from human language,
        high level language example are (Python, javaScript, C#, etc). 
        if you have previous programming experience it's very easy to learn but people who are entirely new to programming might find this a little confusing."
    content2: |
        Fun fact, it is turing complete (meaning you can literally do anything a real computer can, although the practicality is questionable), 
        it is often used for more advanced automation (telling units what to do, disabling/enabling blocks, and more), 
        For more advanced people, they like to mess around just for fun making stuff that are not actually useful to campaign like games, emulators, renderings, etc."
    content3: "mlog is not necessary for the completion of campaign , it is very optional, often the time you spent coding will be more than if you just do it manually.."

    title2: Data types
    integers:
        title: Integers
        content1: "are whole numbers, meaning no decimal, 1,2,3, are integers, 1.001, are not. {hlYel:max-value}"
        intlimit: integer limitations
        content2: |
            The largest integer that can be represented accurately in a single number in Mindustry (double-precision floating-point format) is {hlYel:maxpower}, which equals to {hlYel:maxvalue}
            from {hlYel:minpower}, which is {hlYel:minvalue}.
            Beyond these limits, floating-point representation may lead to inaccuracies due to the way numbers are rounded."
        maxpower: 2^53
        maxvalue: "9007199254740992"
        minpower: -2^53
        minvalue: "-9007199254740992"
    float:
        title: Float
        content: "Opposite of integers, decimal numbers, 1.001, are float."
    boolean:
        title: Boolean
        content: "A data type that can have 1 of 2 states, true or false, 0 or 1."
    strings:
        title: Strings
        content: "a sequence of characters, different from {link:variables:#variables}, in mlog strings are enclosed by \" (quotation mark) (\"Hello, world\" is a string)."

    blreference:
        title: Block or Unit Reference
        content: |
            every block and unit has a unique reference, so every block and unit can be differentiated from each other, 
            internally they look like {code:messagere_ference} or {code:poly_reference}, 
            these are not viewable without modifying the game. 
            in game these references are stored in a variable like {link:building_variable:#links},
            or {link:unit:#unit}, 
            they can also be written to a normal variable"
