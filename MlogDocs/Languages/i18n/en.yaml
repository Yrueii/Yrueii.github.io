    title: Introduction
    title2: What is Mindustry logic?
    content1: |
        Mindustry Logic (mlog) is a scripting language added in v6 for the purpose of introducing more advanced automation and strategy into the game.
        It is heavily inspired by Assembly languages, therefore the language is a low level language making it harder to understand (low level being low to machine language (Assembly, C, etc) and far from human language,
        high level language example are (Python, javaScript, C#, etc). 
        if you have previous programming experience it's very easy to learn but people who are entirely new to programming might find this a little confusing."
    content2: |
        Fun fact, it is turing complete (meaning you can literally do anything a real computer can, although the practicality is questionable), 
        it is often used for more advanced automation (telling units what to do, disabling/enabling blocks, and more), 
        For more advanced people, they like to mess around just for fun making stuff that are not actually useful to campaign like games, emulators, renderings, etc."
    content3: "mlog is not necessary for the completion of campaign , it is very optional, often the time you spent coding will be more than if you just do it manually.."

    integers:

        content1: "are whole numbers, meaning no decimal, 1,2,3, are integers, 1.001, are not."
        intlimit: integer limitations
        content2: |
            The largest integer that can be represented accurately in a single number in Mindustry (double-precision floating-point format) is {hl:maxpower:yel}, which equals to {hl:maxvalue:yel}
            from {hl:minpower:yel}, which is {hl:minvalue:yel}.
            Beyond these limits, floating-point representation may lead to inaccuracies due to the way numbers are rounded."
        maxpower: 2^53
        maxvalue: "9007199254740992"
        minpower: -2^53

    blreference:
        title: Block or Unit Reference
        content: |
            every block and unit has a unique reference, so every block and unit can be differentiated from each other, 
            internally they look like {code:messagere_ference} or {code:poly_reference}, 
            these are not viewable without modifying the game. 
            in game these references are stored in a variable like {link:building_variable:#links},
            or {link:unit:#unit}, 
            they can also be written to a normal variable"

        title: Processors
        content: There are 3 types of Logic Processors, Micro processor, Logic processor, and Hyper processor, each have different speeds and range (Information can be found in the game’s info menu). 
    processors_ui:
        title: Processor’s UI
        content: |
            when opening a processor by clicking the pencil icon: 
            {br} {img:image/ui3.png:left130} 
            {br} you will be prompted to this screen:
            {br} {img:image/ui.png:false}
            {br} the {code:add} button ({img:image/ui7.png:top15 width120}) opens a menu to add an instruction:
            {br} {img:image/ui1.png:false}
            {br} the {code:vars} Vars ({img:image/vars.png:top15 width120}) opens a menu showing all of your variables
            {br}
            {br} this menu is very useful for debugging
            {br} {img:image/data types.png:width800}
            {br} the {code:edit} button ({img:image/ui5.png:top15 width120}) opens a menu to export/import codes
            {br} {img:image/ui2.png:width300 left160 mtop20}
            {br} when clicking “Copy to Clipboard” it will copy the code of the processor to your clipboard, 
                unlike a schematic, mlog code are plain readable text, {link:more_info:#writing-in-text-editor}
            {br} this mlog code can be pasted into a processor again using the "import from clipboard"

        title: How Processor run its code
        content: |
                They Always run Instruction from top to bottom 1 at a time
                You can only jump and wait, you cannot make it run from bottom to top for example.
                Here is a visualization:
                {br} {img:image/print1.gif:width700}
                {br} with jumps:
                {br} {img:image/vis jump.gif:_}
                {br} When the processor reach the end of its instruction it will go back to 0, repeating the loop indefinitely
    links:
        title: Links
        content: | 
            You can link a building to the processor by clicking the processor 
            (you can see a circle, this is the processor range) and clicking the building
            {br} {img:image/link.png:width600}

            {br} {code:display1:variable}
            is now a variable that can be used in the processor, it stores a <a href="#building-reference" >building reference,</a> 
            is also sometimes called a “building variable”,
            {br}building variable cannot be overwritten by any means, 
            {br}in other words, you cannot use this variable to put in an output of an instruction
            {br}however you can copy the its contents to another variable, Like {code:example1:op}
            {br}the variable {code:mybuild:variable} is now the same as {code:display1:variable}, meaning you can use it the same way,
            {br}however {code:mybuild:variable} is an independent variable (your variable) now, this means it also acts like a normal variable,
            for example if the display block that is linked to the processor is destroyed the variable {code:display1:variable} will be null, 
            but {code:mybuild:variable} will still have the last value it was set to, so you can still sensor things like 
            {code:dead:contentname}from it
        display1: display1
        example1: set myBuilding = display1
        mybuild: myBuilding
        dead: "@dead"
    variables:
        title: Variables
        content: |
            Variables are the fundamental of programming, to put it simply, they are just named 
            “containers” to store data to, for example the {code:set:op} instruction sets a variable:
            {br} {img:image/set x 10.png:_}
            {br} This will make {code:x:variable} a variable, this variable can be used for all 
                sort of different things, for example, the {code:operation:op} instruction
            {br} {img:image/operation.png:_}
            {br} Because {code:x:variable} is {hl:ten:yel}
            this operation means {hl:ten:yel} + {hl:five:yel}, and the result of it is written to the {code:result:variable} variable, 
            meaning {code:result:varop} is now {hl:fifteen:yel}. Of course it doesn’t have to be "result", you can write anything for it, 
            different people write their variable differently, some chooses to write arbitrary words/letters like “peach” 
            and others simply write “x+5”, whatever you choose is up to you, just keep in mind you have to remember them.
            {br}
            {br} an {hl:undefined:red} variable will have {hl:null:red} as their default value and this gets coerced to {hl:zero:yel}.
            {br}
            {br}a processor doesn't have a limit on how many variables it can have, however a processor has a 1000 instruction limit

        op: op
        x: x
        ten: "10"
        five: "5"
        fifteen: "15"
        result: result
        undefined: "undefined"
        null: "null"
        zero: "0"
        
        operation: Operation
        increment:
            title: Incrementing Variable
            content: |
                Increment is the act or process of increasing
                {br} {img:image/increment.png:_}
                {br} Since processor loops, this will increase {code:x:varop} by {hl:one:yel} every loop, as time goes on x will 
                get bigger and bigger. This is what’s called incrementing a variable
            x: x
            one: "1"
