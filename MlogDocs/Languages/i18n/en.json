        "content1": "Mindustry Logic (mlog) is a scripting language added in v6 for the purpose of introducing more advanced automation and strategy into the game  It is heavily inspired by Assembly languages, therefore the language is a low level language making it harder to understand (low level being low to machine language (Assembly, C, etc) and far from human language, high level language example are (Python, javaScript, C#, etc) if you have previous programming experience it's very easy to learn but people who are entirely new to programming might find this a little confusing.",
        "content2": "Fun fact, it is turing complete (meaning you can literally do anything a real computer can, although the practicality is questionable), it is often used for more advanced automation (telling units what to do, disabling/enabling blocks, and more), For more advanced people, they like to mess around just for fun making stuff that are not actually useful to campaign like games, emulators, renderings, etc.",
        "content3": "mlog is not necessary for the completion of campaign , it is very optional, often the time you spent coding will be more than if you just do it manually.."
